Kubernetes is an orchestrator for containers

Imperative : command based, what we want to do is written as command
Declarative : file based like yaml, what we want to do is declared in file

Some kubernetes objects:
pod                   volume                secrets             statefulset
service               deployment            configmap           daemonset
namespace             replicaset            jobs

Manifest file
Above objects are declared in yaml/yml files called as manifest files.

In chef we have recipies
In Ansible we have playbooks
Similarly, in kubernetes we have manifest files

Think of 
Object as work to be done
POD as VM
Container as processes or some sort of application say java springboot web application @GetMapping

Spec - desired state we want
